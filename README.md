# Flight Booker

This is a project from the **Advanced Forms and Active Record** section in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-advanced-forms)'s Ruby on Rails curriculum. 

## Live Project
You can view this [web app](https://odnflightbooker.herokuapp.com/) on Heroku. The heroku server will need a little bit of time to fire up a dyno, so please be patient with this free service.

Book any flight on 01/01/2023.
